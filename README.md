## 📖 About the Runes

### What are Runes?
Runes are the letters of ancient Germanic alphabets used by Norse, Germanic, and Anglo-Saxon peoples from roughly 150 CE to 800 CE. But they were more than just letters—each rune represented a concept, a force, or a spiritual principle.

### The Elder Futhark
The oldest runic alphabet, consisting of 24 characters divided into three groups of eight (called *aettir* or families):
- **Freyr's Aett** - Prosperity and earthly matters
- **Heimdall's Aett** - Challenge and transformation
- **Tyr's Aett** - Cosmic order and completion

### Why "Futhark"?
Like "alphabet" comes from "alpha-beta," Futhark comes from the first six runes: **F**ehu, **U**ruz, **Th**urisaz, **A**nsuz, **R**aidho, **K**enaz.

## 🌟 Usage

Draw runes randomly to gain insight. See the Quick Reference for common spreads.

### For Programming

### For Spiritual Practice
