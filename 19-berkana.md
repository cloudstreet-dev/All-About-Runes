## Historical Context

Berkana represents the birch tree—a symbol of new beginnings, birth, and motherhood in Norse culture. The birch was the first tree to return after the Ice Age, pioneering new growth in barren lands. It symbolizes fertility, nurturing, growth, and the feminine creative principle.

In practical terms, birch was used for cradles, protective charms for children, and purification rituals. The rune embodies the nurturing mother, the fertile earth, and all processes of growth and renewal.

## Shape and Form

Berkana (ᛒ) resembles the letter "B" or a pregnant woman viewed from the side. It consists of a vertical line with two rounded protrusions on the right, suggesting breasts or a pregnant belly.

The shape suggests fertility, nurturing, and the creative feminine principle.
