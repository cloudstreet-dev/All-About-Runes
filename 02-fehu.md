# Chapter 2: Fehu (ᚠ) - Wealth and Abundance

## The Rune

**Symbol:** ᚠ
**Name:** Fehu (pronounced "FAY-who" or "FEH-hoo")
**Literal Meaning:** Cattle, Wealth, Livestock
**Unicode:** U+16A0
**UTF-8:** E1 9A A0

## Historical Context

Fehu is the very first rune of the Elder Futhark, and appropriately, it represents wealth and prosperity. In Viking Age Scandinavia, wealth wasn't measured in gold coins but in cattle. The more cattle you owned, the wealthier you were considered. Cattle provided milk, meat, leather, and were also a form of mobile currency that could be traded.

This rune embodies the concept of moveable wealth—assets that can be transferred, shared, or traded. It's about abundance that flows, not wealth that sits stagnant in a vault.

## Shape and Form

The shape of Fehu (ᚠ) resembles cattle horns reaching upward, or some say it looks like branches of a tree bearing fruit. It consists of a vertical line with two diagonal lines extending upward to the right, forming a distinctive "F" shape that our modern letter F descended from.

When carved into wood or stone, Vikings would typically carve from bottom to top, with the two branches pointing toward the sky—symbolizing growth and aspiration.

## Pronunciation Guide

**Name:** Fehu
**Sound:** "F" as in "fish" or "fortune"

In Old Norse, this rune represented the /f/ sound. It's one of the more straightforward runes to pronounce—just like our modern F.

## Symbolic Meanings

### Primary Meanings:
- **Wealth and prosperity** (both material and spiritual)
- **Abundance and success**
- **Energy and vitality**
- **Moveable possessions**
- **Luck and good fortune**

### In Divination:
- **Upright:** Financial gain, success in endeavors, earned reward, abundance flowing into your life, prosperity shared with others
- **Reversed (Merkstave):** Loss of wealth, failed ventures, greed, poor financial decisions, stagnation

### Spiritual Significance:
Fehu reminds us that wealth is meant to flow. Like cattle that must be tended, moved to fresh pastures, and sometimes traded, prosperity requires active management. It teaches that:
- Wealth should be earned through effort
- Abundance increases when shared
- Material success brings responsibility
- Energy must circulate to remain vital

## Historical Usage

Archaeological evidence shows Fehu appearing on various Viking Age artifacts:
- **Talismans and amulets** for attracting prosperity
- **Boundary markers** to denote ownership
- **Trade goods** to invoke successful commerce
- **Runic inscriptions** asking for blessings of abundance

One famous example is the Kylver Stone from Gotland, Sweden (around 400 CE), which displays the full Elder Futhark beginning with Fehu—possibly as a magical formula or simply a demonstration of the alphabet.

## Modern Applications

### In Programming:
```python
# Python example: Displaying Fehu
fehu = '\u16A0'
print(f"The rune Fehu: {fehu}")
print(f"Unicode code point: U+{ord(fehu):04X}")

# Output:
# The rune Fehu: ᚠ
# Unicode code point: U+16A0
```

### In Meditation and Reflection:
- Focus on Fehu when starting new business ventures
- Use it to meditate on the flow of energy in your life
- Contemplate what "wealth" truly means to you
- Reflect on how you can share your abundance

### Magical Workings:
Traditionally, Fehu was carved or drawn:
- On business documents or contracts
- On wallet or purse (for financial prosperity)
- At the entrance of shops or trading posts
- On seed bags for abundant harvests

## Fehu in Modern Culture

Today, Fehu appears in:
- **Video games** with Norse themes (like God of War, Assassin's Creed Valhalla)
- **Jewelry and tattoos** representing prosperity
- **Business logos** for companies wanting to invoke success
- **Typography and design** as a unique decorative element

## Key Takeaways

1. Fehu is the rune of mobile, flowing wealth
2. It represents not just material prosperity but vital energy
3. The symbol teaches that wealth must circulate to grow
4. It's pronounced like the modern letter F
5. In Unicode, it's U+16A0

*Why did the Viking bring a rune stone to the bank? Because he wanted to make a Fehu-ture investment!*

## Practical Exercise

Try writing Fehu by hand:
1. Draw a vertical line from bottom to top
2. Add two diagonal lines from the middle, angling upward to the right
3. Practice until the shape feels natural

Now say its name aloud: "Fehu"
Contemplate: What does abundance mean in your life?
